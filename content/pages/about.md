      Kaufman and Associates is a father son law firm, and the firm of choice
      for any and all legal advice and representation in the Chicagoland Area.
      Specializing in Real Estate Transactions, Evictions, Civil Law, Real
      Estate Disputes, and Business Law, our skilled and competent Chicago
      lawyers have years of experience representing individual clients and
      corporations.


      Kaufman and Associate's services go way beyond court trials and out of
      court settlements, however. Our skilled attorneys make it a point to
      support their clients from the very beginning all the way to the very end,
      offering counsel, advice, and studying each and every case closely to
      ensure every detail of the case is taken into account and used to their
      client's benefit. We also provide follow-up services in cases where paper
      work or applications must be filled.
